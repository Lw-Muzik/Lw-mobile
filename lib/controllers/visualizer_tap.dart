/// When the native FFT/PCM tap should be running.
///
/// The tap is not free: it runs on every decoded audio buffer, computes an FFT,
/// and pushes a packet over a platform channel ~30 times a second. Whatever is
/// listening then schedules a frame for each packet, so an idle tap does not
/// merely waste its own CPU — it drives the whole render pipeline, including
/// the background blurs, at 30fps for a picture nobody asked for.
///
/// It used to be governed by a master switch that sat alongside the two
/// switches for the surfaces that actually draw it. Three switches for two
/// things is one too many: the master could be off while a surface was on
/// (a visualizer that silently never moved), or on while both were off (this
/// class's whole cost, invisibly, forever). The tap is now *implied* — it runs
/// exactly when some surface needs it.
///
/// Kept apart from `AppController` because the rule is pure boolean logic whose
/// failures are invisible on screen, and because the redundant-push suppression
/// below is the only thing standing between a rebuild and a platform call.
class VisualizerTap {
  /// The visualizer drawn on the player screen.
  bool playerVisual = false;

  /// The visualizer drawn behind the whole app.

  /// Silences the tap without forgetting what the user asked for, so that
  /// backgrounding the app can stop the capture and resuming can restore it.
  bool suspended = false;

  /// The last value handed to [pendingPush], or null if the native side has
  /// never been told anything. Native boots in an unknown state, so the first
  /// push always happens even when it agrees with the default.

  bool get shouldRun => !suspended && (playerVisual || backgroundVisual);

  /// lifecycle event — and only a genuine change crosses the platform channel.
