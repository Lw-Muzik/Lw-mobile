/// # What actually makes a mix feel personal
///
/// Not the recommendations — a phone has nobody to ask. Three things:
///
/// * **Clustering.** A library is not one taste, it is several. Building one
///   list out of all of them produces something that is nobody's mix. So the
///   library is split into the groups it naturally falls into and each gets its
///   own, and a group too small or too vague to be a taste gets **no mix at
///   all** rather than a thin one.
/// * **Rediscovery.** A mix of the twenty tracks someone plays most is a mix
///   they could have made themselves. Roughly two fifths of each one is music
///   they own and have barely heard.
/// * **Time.** The same mix every day is the complaint this feature exists to
///   answer. The draw is seeded with the date *and the part of the day*, so a
///   mix is stable while you are looking at it, different this evening, and
///   different again tomorrow — and once there is listening history, weighted
///   towards what this person actually reaches for at this hour.
///
/// Everything here is plain values in and plain values out: no database, no
/// clock, no random source of its own. `now` and the candidate list are
/// arguments, which is what makes "the same day gives the same mix" a testable
/// claim rather than a hope.
