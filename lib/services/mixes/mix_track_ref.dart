/// One track in a mix, before it is playable.

/// # Why a reference and not a `SongModel`
///
/// A local file is playable the moment it is read out of the database. A drive
/// file needs a link minted for it — a request each, on Dropbox. A YouTube
/// track needs resolving, which is another request and produces a URL that
/// expires in hours.
///
/// Building six mixes of twenty-five tracks would therefore mean up to a hundred
/// and fifty requests, on opening the home page, for cards the user may never
/// tap — and most of those URLs would be dead by the time they did. So a mix
/// holds references, and resolution happens when one is played.
