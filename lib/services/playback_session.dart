///
/// The queue, which track of it was playing, how far into that track, and the
/// two settings that decide what plays next. Not the playing state: an app that
/// starts making noise because it was opened is a bad guest, so a restored
/// session is always paused and waits to be told.
///
/// # Written to a file, not to preferences
///
/// A radio queue is routinely a few hundred entries and each is a map of a
/// dozen fields. `SharedPreferences` is loaded whole on every launch and every
/// other setting in the app shares it; putting a 200 KB queue in there taxes
/// code that has nothing to do with playback.
///
/// # Serialisation is separate from storage
///
/// [PlaybackSession] knows how to become JSON and back; [PlaybackSessionStore]
/// knows about the disk. The half that has the edge cases — a queue longer than
/// the cap, a shuffled order referring to tracks that are gone, a file written
/// by an older version — is the half that can be tested without a device.
