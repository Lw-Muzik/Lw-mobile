/// The InnerTube calls behind Discover.
///
/// Five endpoints, no authentication of any kind. That is a deliberate
/// difference from hype-desktop, which browses with a captured cookie jar:
/// measured live against every surface this app uses, YouTube answers all of
/// them signed out — 38 mood categories, five shelves on a genre page, twenty
/// rows per search filter, a playlist's tracks, and a plaintext audio URL. So
/// mobile has no sign-in wall, nothing to expire, and nothing to keep secret.
///
/// # The client identities, and why there are four
///
/// * **WEB_REMIX** — browse, search, suggestions and radio. It is the client YT
///   Music's own web app presents, so its responses are the shapes the parsers
///   in `parse/` were written against.
/// * **VISIONOS** — stream resolution, and since 2026-08-20 the client that
///   leads for both audio and video. Its URLs are *plaintext* (no signature
///   cipher, no n-parameter JS) **and un-gated**: they serve a whole file to
///   one open-ended request. See [visionOsVersion].
/// * **ANDROID_VR** — what VISIONOS replaced, kept one step behind it. It led
///   this list until YouTube closed both sides of its 1.64 wall on the same
///   day: bot-checked below that version, proof-of-origin gated at and above
///   it. Every version in [androidVrVersions] is below the wall, so it now
///   fails *loudly* rather than resolving into silence — which is the only
///   reason it is still worth asking at all. See [androidVrVersions].
/// * **IOS** — video only, and only where AVPlayer leaves no choice: it is the
///   one client that ever offers an `hlsManifestUrl`. It is **not** an audio
///   fallback; see `YtWorker.audioClientOrder` for the measurement that took it
///   out of that list.
///
/// # `visitorData` is what makes a refused client worth asking twice
///
/// Measured live, ANDROID_VR answered `LOGIN_REQUIRED` — *"Sign in to confirm
/// you're not a bot"* — for six of seven videos. The obvious reading is that the
/// client is burned. It isn't: **the same request with a `visitorData` attached
/// answers `OK` and hands back a plaintext itag 140 url**, even on the older
/// client version. The refusal response itself carries a usable `visitorData` in
/// its `responseContext`, so one is always obtainable — [_visitorData] captures
/// it from every response and [player] asks again after learning one.
///
/// A token also *stops* being accepted, and that case is the one that bites: a
/// held token used to suppress the retry entirely, so one refusal turned into a
/// session that never resolved anything again. [player] now drops a token that
/// has been refused and earns a new one. See its doc comment.
///
/// # Why the order matters more than it looks
///
/// IOS urls are **PO-token prefix-gated: only the first ~1 MiB is ever served**,
/// whatever the Range. That is roughly 64 seconds of itag 140, after which every
/// request 403s — including the sequentially-next chunk. It is invisible to any
/// test that reads a small prefix, which is exactly how it survived a whole
/// round of "verified live" probes here. ANDROID_VR joined it behind that wall
/// on 2026-08-18 and lost its other side on 08-20; VISIONOS urls have no such
/// wall, which is the entire reason it leads.
///
/// # What rots
///
/// The client identities below are the thing that ages, and they age *fast*:
/// ANDROID_VR went from load-bearing to unusable in two days. When resolution
/// starts failing across the board, re-measure before suspecting anything
/// cleverer — a dead identity looks identical to a policy change.
///
/// Two rules, both learned the expensive way:
///
/// 1. **Only an open-ended `Range: bytes=0-` read past 1 MiB proves anything.**
///    A gated url answers every bounded range inside its first mebibyte, so a
///    64 KB probe reports health on a url that plays nothing. That trap has
///    cost this project three separate days.
/// 2. **Copy yt-dlp's `_DEFAULT_CLIENTS`, not its client table.** The table
///    still lists identities upstream keeps for authenticated or PO-token
///    users; on 2026-08-18 its `android_vr` pin was on the *wrong* side of the
///    wall, so following it was worse than following nothing.
