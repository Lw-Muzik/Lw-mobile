/// A category page is ~86 KB on the wire and **1.9 MB decompressed** — measured,
/// not estimated. Decoding that much JSON and walking it takes long enough to
/// drop frames if it happens on the UI isolate, and Discover is the first tab on
/// iOS, so that cost would land on the app's opening screen.
///
/// # Why it is long-lived rather than `Isolate.run` per call
///
/// `Isolate.run` spawns and tears down an isolate per call, which means a new
/// [HttpClient] per call, which means a full TLS handshake per call — a few
/// hundred milliseconds of latency added to every tap, on the mobile radio where
/// it costs the most. One isolate that outlives the requests keeps its
/// connection pool warm, and the spawn is paid once.
///
/// Only small parsed models cross the port. The 1.9 MB tree is decoded, walked
/// and discarded inside the isolate — it never exists on the UI side at all.
