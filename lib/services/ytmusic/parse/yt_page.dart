/// Reading a catalog page — the shelves a mood, genre, artist or search
/// response is made of.
///
/// # One walk, every surface
///
/// A mood page, an artist page and a search response are the same construction:
/// shelves of items. They differ only in which of the three shelf renderers they
/// reach for and how deeply they bury them, so [parsePage] walks for the shelves
/// themselves rather than navigating an envelope. Measured on live responses: a
/// genre page is five `musicCarouselShelfRenderer`s, an artist page mixes one
/// `musicShelfRenderer` with eight carousels, and a filtered search is a single
/// `musicShelfRenderer` — the same reader serves all three, and no surface needs
/// its own path.
///
/// # Reading by meaning, not by position
///
/// Where a row states a fact varies by surface: search puts a song's album in
/// flexible column 1, a genre page puts it in column 2, and column 2 of a search
/// row is the play count instead. Every one of those runs, however, carries its
/// own `browseEndpoint` naming what it opens — so a run linking to an album *is*
/// the album, wherever it sits. Reading the link rather than the index is what
/// makes one parser correct on all of them.
///
/// # The rule that shapes everything here
///
/// **Nothing in this file may throw.** An unreadable item is skipped, an unknown
/// shelf is skipped, and a page we understand nothing of is *empty*, never an
/// error. YouTube reshaping one genre must cost that shelf, not Discover.
