/// Getting YouTube tracks into the player.

/// # Why the queue grows instead of being built
///
/// A YouTube track's URL only exists once it has been resolved, one request per
/// track. Resolving a fifty-track playlist before the first note would be five
/// to ten seconds of spinner. So the tapped track is resolved alone, playback
/// starts on it, and the rest arrive behind it — appended to the live queue,
/// never reloaded into it, because reloading would restart the song the user is
/// already listening to.
///
/// # What "play" means here
///
/// Tapping a track plays **from that track to the end of the list**, which is
/// what appending can express without ever disturbing what is already playing.
/// The tracks above it are reachable by "Play all", which starts at the top and
/// therefore queues everything.
