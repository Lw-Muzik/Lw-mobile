/// Everything below is a thin front for [YtWorker] plus the three caches that

/// unevenness is the design:
///
/// * **Categories are cached to disk.** They are the landing screen — first tab
///   on iOS — and they change perhaps monthly. Rendering them from disk means
///   opening the app costs no network at all before something is on screen.
/// * **Category pages are never cached to disk**, only held for the session.
///   Discover's whole value is being current, and a stale copy of YouTube's
///   catalog is just a worse Library. The session LRU exists so pressing back
///   doesn't re-fetch what's still on screen.
/// * **Stream URLs are cached until they expire**, and not one second past —
///   googlevideo states its own deadline and a URL served after it is a stall.
