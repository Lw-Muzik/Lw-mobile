/// How a station decides what belongs next to a track it already has.

/// # Why this is arithmetic and not a service
///
/// YouTube answers "what goes with this?" with a network call. A file on the
/// user's disk has nobody to ask. What it does have is metadata — artist,
/// genre, album, when it was added, how often it has been played — and that is
/// enough to build a station that is recognisably *about* the seed rather than
/// a shuffle wearing its name.
///
/// The whole thing is plain values in and plain values out: no database, no
/// network, no singletons. That is deliberate. A station's taste is the part
/// most worth testing and the part least worth mocking a database for.
