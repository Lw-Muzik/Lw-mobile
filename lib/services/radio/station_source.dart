/// Where a station's next tracks come from.
///
/// # The seam
///
/// A station is two jobs wearing one name. One is bookkeeping: which station is
/// playing, what it has already handed over, how close the queue is to running
/// out, whether the user has switched Autoplay off. That job is identical
/// whether the music is on YouTube, on the phone, or in a Google Drive folder,
/// and it is where every bug this class has ever had actually lived.
///
/// The other job is answering "what goes with this?", and that one is entirely
/// different per source: YouTube has an endpoint, a local library has metadata
/// and arithmetic, a cloud drive has thinner metadata and the same arithmetic.
///
/// [StationSource] is the second job. `RadioQueue` is the first.
///
/// # Why a new source object per station
///
/// A YouTube continuation token belongs to a *query*, not to a seed: sending
/// the previous station's token with the new station's seed returns the next
/// page of the previous station, and that once poisoned every later top-up
/// until the app was restarted.
///
/// Keeping the cursor inside the source object makes that structurally
/// impossible — a new station is a new object, so there is no field for a stale
/// cursor to survive in. Callers must therefore build a fresh source per
/// station and never reuse one.
